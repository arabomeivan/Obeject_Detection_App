## Introduction
This repository contains a real-time object detection model that uses the COCO SSD model with TensorFlow.js and React.js. The application detects and classifies objects from a live video feed captured through a webcam.

## Features
- Real-time object detection from webcam video feed.
- Utilizes COCO SSD model for detecting and classifying objects.
- User-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite components.
- Easy setup and deployment using npm.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-detection.git
    cd real-time-object-detection
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

3. Allow access to your webcam when prompted. The application will start detecting objects in real-time.

## Dependencies
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Library for machine learning in JavaScript.
- **COCO SSD**: Pre-trained model for object detection.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Flowbite**: Components built with Tailwind CSS.
- **React Webcam**: Webcam component for React.

## Model Details
The application uses the COCO SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model pre-trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. This model can detect and classify 80 different types of objects, including people, cars, and animals.
